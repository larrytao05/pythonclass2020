What is Map/Filter/Reduce?

Mapping is when you "map" a function or method onto all of the values in a list,
for example capitalizing the first letter of every string in a list.
Filtering is when you select a few values from a list instead of all of them.
Reducing is when you combine all of the values of a list into one.

What does list method 'sort' or 'append' return?

'sort' returns void, but puts the list in a different order(default is alphabetical order or least to greatest).
'append' returns void as well, but changes the list by addin the append value attached at the end.
