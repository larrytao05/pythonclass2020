# What we learned in last lesson:

# What is a function definition

# def name_function(parameters): | doesn't run code, it just defines function

# What is a function call

# name_function(parameters) | calls the function and actually runs the code

# Function arguments parameters

# statements that the function takes to then output something else

# Execution flow

# python runs from top to bottom, so if you put your definition after you call the function it won't work

# Fruitful function vs void function

# fruitful functions return a new value, like changing the number 5 to 10
# void functions just perform an action, like printing something, but they won't return a new value
